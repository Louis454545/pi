Morgan is a minimal terminal computer-agent harness. Adapt morgan to your workflows, not the other way around, without having to fork and modify morgan internals. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), [Schedules](#schedules), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Morgan Packages](#morgan-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.

Morgan ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask morgan to build what you want or install a third party morgan package that matches your workflow.

Morgan runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps. See [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for a real-world SDK integration.

## Share Your OSS Morgan Conversations

If you use morgan for open source work, please share your morgan conversations.

Public OSS session data helps improve models, prompts, tools, and evaluations using real development workflows.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/morgan-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/morgan-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `morgan-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `morgan-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `morgan-mono` work sessions here:

- [badlogicgames/morgan-mono on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/badlogicgames/morgan-mono)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/morgan-agent
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. Morgan does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

Installer alternative:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://morgan.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
morgan
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
morgan
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to morgan. By default, morgan gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [morgan packages](#morgan-packages).

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, morgan maintains a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L).

**Subscriptions:**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- GitHub Copilot

**API keys:**
- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock
- Mistral
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Cloudflare AI Gateway
- Cloudflare Workers AI
- xAI
- OpenRouter
- Vercel AI Gateway
- ZAI
- OpenCode Zen
- OpenCode Go
- Hugging Face
- Fireworks
- Together AI
- Kimi For Coding
- MiniMax
- Xiaomi MiMo
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (China)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Amsterdam)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Singapore)

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.morgan/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

---

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working context, conversation name, total token/cache usage, cost, context usage, current model

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/cwd <path>` | Set explicit working context and load project resources |
| `/reset` | Archive and reset the global conversation |
| `/import <file>` | Import a JSONL file into the global conversation |
| `/name <name>` | Set conversation display name |
| `/session` | Show conversation info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/schedule` | Show project-local schedule status |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the conversation tree and continue from there |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export conversation to HTML file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit morgan |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.morgan/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so morgan can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Global Conversation

Morgan saves one canonical global conversation at `~/.morgan/sessions/global/conversation.jsonl`. `morgan` and `morgan -p` continue that conversation by default. On first launch after upgrading, morgan imports the most recent valid legacy session into the global conversation.

Use `--cwd <path>` at startup or `/cwd <path>` interactively when you want tools, AGENTS.md, project settings, and project resources loaded from a specific directory. Without an explicit working context, morgan does not use the shell launch directory as project context.

```bash
morgan                         # Continue the global conversation
morgan --cwd .                 # Continue with this directory as working context
morgan --no-session            # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current conversation file and stats.

### Tree Navigation

**`/tree`** - Navigate the conversation tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history is preserved in the global conversation file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/reset`** archives the current canonical file under `~/.morgan/sessions/global/archive/` and starts a fresh global conversation.

**`/import <jsonl>`** archives the current canonical file and replaces it with the imported JSONL after confirmation.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.morgan/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.morgan/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### Telemetry and update checks

Morgan has two separate startup features:

- **Update check:** fetches `https://morgan.dev/api/latest-version` to check whether a newer Morgan version exists. Disable it with `MORGAN_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`. Disabling update checks only turns off this check.
- **Install/update telemetry:** after first install or a changelog-detected update, sends an anonymous version ping to `https://morgan.dev/api/report-install`. Opt out by setting `enableInstallTelemetry` to `false` in `settings.json`, or by setting `MORGAN_TELEMETRY=0`. This does not disable update checks; Morgan may still contact `morgan.dev` for the latest version unless update checks are disabled or offline mode is enabled.

Use `--offline` or `MORGAN_OFFLINE=1` to disable all startup network operations described here, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry.

---

## Context Files

Morgan loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.morgan/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

Use for project instructions, conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.morgan/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.morgan/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.morgan/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.morgan/agent/prompts/`, `.morgan/prompts/`, or a [morgan package](#morgan-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.morgan/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `~/.morgan/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.morgan/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [morgan package](#morgan-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend morgan with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, proactive triggers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (morgan: ExtensionAPI) {
  morgan.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  morgan.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  morgan.registerTrigger({ name: "watch-ci", start: async (ctx, emit) => { ... } });
  morgan.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. morgan waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `morgan.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Proactive triggers that emit structured events and let the agent decide whether to notify you
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make morgan look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.morgan/agent/extensions/`, `.morgan/extensions/`, or a [morgan package](#morgan-packages) to share with others. For generated personal triggers, prefer a `triggers/<id>` subdirectory under the configured global agent extension directory. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Schedules

Trusted project-local TypeScript schedules run while morgan is open. Place them in `.morgan/schedules/` under an explicit working context (`--cwd` or `/cwd`). See [docs/schedules.md](docs/schedules.md).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and morgan immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.morgan/agent/themes/`, `.morgan/themes/`, or a [morgan package](#morgan-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Morgan Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1457744485428629628).

> **Security:** Morgan packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
morgan install npm:@foo/morgan-tools
morgan install npm:@foo/morgan-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
morgan install git:github.com/user/repo
morgan install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
morgan install git:git@github.com:user/repo
morgan install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
morgan install https://github.com/user/repo
morgan install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
morgan install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
morgan install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
morgan remove npm:@foo/morgan-tools
morgan uninstall npm:@foo/morgan-tools          # alias for remove
morgan list
morgan update                               # update morgan and packages (skips pinned packages)
morgan update --extensions                  # update packages only
morgan update --self                        # update morgan only
morgan update --self --force                # reinstall morgan even if current
morgan update npm:@foo/morgan-tools             # update one package
morgan config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.morgan/agent/git/` (git) or `~/.morgan/agent/npm/` (npm). Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.morgan/git/`, `.morgan/npm/`). Git `@ref` values are pinned tags or commits; pinned packages are skipped by `morgan update`, so use `morgan install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to move an existing package to a new ref. Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding a `morgan` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-morgan-package",
  "keywords": ["morgan-package"],
  "morgan": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `morgan` manifest, morgan auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

---

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@earendil-works/morgan-agent";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRegistry = ModelRegistry.create(authStorage);
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage,
  modelRegistry,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
morgan --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

Morgan is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [morgan packages](#morgan-packages). This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape morgan to fit how you work.

**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support. [Why?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)

**Sub-agents are tools, not magic state.** The built-in `subagent` tool creates named child sessions with their own JSONL traces. Parent and child agents can exchange asynchronous notifications, and `task_stop` can stop running subagents.

**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.

**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).

**Background bash is explicit.** Use `bash` background mode or `monitor` when the agent needs managed background work with traceable notifications.

Read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-morgan-agent/) for the full rationale.
